# Summary
This simple ASP.NET Core Web API app demonstrates the basics of creating a RESTful API endpoint. It includes a controller that handles HTTP GET requests and returns a list of weather forecasts. The application uses dependency injection for logging and employs attribute-based routing to define the endpoint. The weather data is generated randomly for demonstration purposes.

# Running the Application
#### Navigate to the project directory
```sh
cd path/to/your/project
```

#### Build and run the application
```sh
dotnet build

dotnet run
```

#### Access the endpoint
Open a browser or API testing tool and navigate to

```sh
http://localhost:5000/WeatherForecast
```
